## 🛠️ Guide to Fix Missing References and Package Issues

### Step 1: Install or Update Packages

- Open your project’s package manager.
- Check for any missing or outdated packages.
- Install any missing packages.
- Update all packages to their **latest stable versions**.

### Step 2: Clean the Solution

- In your development environment, go to `Build → Clean Solution`.
- This removes old build files and ensures a fresh start.

### Step 3: Rebuild the Solution

- Go to `Build → Rebuild Solution`.
- This will recompile all files and ensure that references and packages are correctly linked.

### Step 4: Run the Project
